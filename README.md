# Re-Plate for Android

Replate is an web platform that connects businesses with excess food at the end of the day with non-profits that can use that food. Businesses sign up, post Pickup Requests that volunteers will then accept and pick-up. Those pick-ups will then be transfered to nearby shelters and non-profits to make use of the food.
